# Architecture

## Stack

LUNA is a [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) application, which uses [Craco](https://craco.js.org) to customize the Webpack configuration. ESLint and Prettier are used as linters to enforce a consistent code style.

## File Structure

The file structure is based on the ["grouping by file type"](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-file-type) convention.
